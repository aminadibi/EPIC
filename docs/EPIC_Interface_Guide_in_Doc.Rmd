## Introduction

This guide aims to provide a basic introduction to the interface of the EPIC model. The purpose of this document is to familiarize the user with nuts and bolts of interacting with the EPIC model, including the steps involved in setting up the EPIC model using desired paramteres, running simulations and producing the results in graphical and tabular formats. A discussion of the innerworkings of the model and the under-the-hood algorithms is beyond the scope of this document. Please note that this document is automatically generated using a markdown tool; it is a work in progress.

## System Information
This document is generated using 
```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=NA, results="asis"}
cat(version$version.string)
```

## EPIC Files
The following files are necessary in order to run the model:

| name and location |                   functionality                  | 
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
|  ./code.R         | The main model code that is executed in R        | 
|  ./input.R        | Includes model input parameters                  | 
|  ./C/model.WIP.cpp| The computational engine of the model in C       | 
|   ./validation.R  | Functions and tools to check the validity of the model| 
|   ./calibration.R | Calibration of the model                         | 
|   ./report.R      | Produces graphical results from the model        |

## Quick Setup
1. Open code.R in RStudio. In this file, you can set the default settings for running the model. These include the following. A more comperehensive discussion of model settings and their values can be found in subsequent sections.  
```{r echo=FALSE, comment=NA, cache=FALSE} 
names(default_settings) 
```
2. Set model settings in Core.R to desired values, if required. 
3. Source Core.R
4. Initialize a session. This is done using the following command:  
```{r, echo=TRUE, comment=NA}
init_session()
```
If you cannot see the output as above, the model is not being compiled correctly. Make sure your R and R Studio are updated and all required packages are installed.  
4. Run the simulation, using the following command. 
```{r, echo=TRUE, comment=NA}
run()
```
If you cannot see the output as above, the simulation is not being carried out correctly. For running the simulation for a smaller number of patients (n), you can type in Run(n), i.e. Run (1000).  
5. Get the output.  
6. Terminate the session to release allocated resources. 
```{r, echo=TRUE, comment=NA}
terminate_session()
```

## Model Validation
Functions for model validation can be accessed once validation.R is sourced. The following functions are available:

1. sanity_check()
2. validate_population(remove_COPD=0,incidence_k=1)
3. validate_smoking()
4. sanity_COPD()
5. validate_COPD()
6. validate_mortality()
7. validate_comorbidity()
8. validate_lung_function()

### sanity_check()
The first and the most basic validation function is called sanity_check(). When sanity_check() is called, the following test cases are checked:

1. The case where all costs are zero. The test will pass if the model returns total cost as zero, and fails otherwise.
2. The case where all utilities are zero. The test will pass if the model returns total QALY as zero, and fails otherwise.
3. The case where all utilites are set as 1 and there is no discounting. The test will pass if the model returns total QALY as equal to cumulative time, and fails otherwise.
4. The case where all mortality rates are zero. The test will pass if the model returns total deaths as zero, and fails otherwise.

An example of the outcome of the function can be see below:
```{r, echo=TRUE, comment=NA}
sanity_check()
```

### validate_population (remove_COPD=0,incidence_k=1)

The validate_population function is responsible for producing output that can be used to test if the demographic module is calibrated properly. It produces multiple population pyramid plots that compare EPIC's demographic with that predicted by StatCan.  

<!--
An example of the outcome of the function can be see below:
```{r, echo=TRUE, comment=NA}
validate_population()
```
<!--
### validate_smoking()
An example of the outcome of the function can be see below:
```{r, echo=TRUE, comment=NA}
validate_smoking()
```

### sanity_COPD()
An example of the outcome of the function can be see below:
```{r, echo=TRUE, comment=NA}
sanity_COPD()
```

### validate_COPD()
An example of the outcome of the function can be see below:
```{r, echo=TRUE, comment=NA}
validate_COPD()
```

### validate_mortality()
An example of the outcome of the function can be see below:
```{r, echo=TRUE, comment=NA}
validate_mortality()
```

### validate_comorbidity()
An example of the outcome of the function can be see below:
```{r, echo=TRUE, comment=NA}
validate_comorbidity()
```

### validate_lung_function()
An example of the outcome of the function can be see below:
```{r, echo=TRUE, comment=NA}
validate_lung_function()
```

## Troubleshooting
* **R crashes when I try to produce results using, say, Cget_all_events.**
* You have probably terminated the session. Once the session is terminatedins, you are no longer able to run C functions (that is, all the functions whose names start with capital C), as C will not have access to it
